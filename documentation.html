    <h1>Movie Api</h1>
    <p>
      The myFlix application is a full-stack JavaScript project designed to
      provide users with access to a rich database of movies, directors, and
      genres. The app allows users to register, update their profiles, and
      manage a list of favorite movies. It features a fully functional REST API
      built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, incorporating user
      authentication, data validation, and secure storage. This server-side
      component handles all data interactions and business logic, serving as the
      backbone for a responsive front-end interface that will later be developed
      using React. The app is built to be deployed online, offering a consistent
      user experience across all devices.
